His sound is complex, richly textured and highly seductive, ideal so to open this year's festival with his Thursday performance at SonarVillage. Skygaze is the musical project by Jaime Tellado, an architect by profession and a music fan from an early age. He began producing under his current alias in 2103, quickly drawing attention from small labels like SoullessLab, PyraFunk, Love Our Records and Pentax. Last year he secured an artistic residency in the Laboral de Gijón art centre, and he recently participated on the excellent compilation 'Iberian Juke Vol. 1', curated by BSN Posse.

Dub is a malleable and highly flammable material in the hands of STA.

Their music draws directly from the original sources of Jamaican dub, with echoes of King Tubby, Lee Perry and Augustus Pablo, revamping an already revolutionised sound using effects, winds (trumpet, melody) and abrasive electronic beats. The result is absolutely magnetic. STA first began -operating between Mallorca and Barcelona- in 2004 as a studio project with a single member and several self-released EPs. However from 2007, several musicians joined the adventure to form today’s line-up: Besides Pope (effects, trumpet, melody, synthesizers and percussion), there is Gato (drums), Holy (guitar), Loro (bass) and Gum (electronics, percussion). All members are Argentines, although through the formation of STA and their residence in Spain, they could be considered a Spanish band. More important than their origin is their approach to the genre and their spectacular sound and on stage attitude.

'The Well' is a high-flying audiovisual show, in which Biard's lighting and stage presentation illustrates Koreless' characteristic hypnotic compositions. A resident of Glasgow although born in Wales, Lewis Roberts - aka Koreless - began making music at the tender age of 9 years old. A big fan of classic jazz, with John Coltrane highest on his pedestal, Koreless discovered electronic music soon afterwards, and he began releasing material under the name with which he is now internationally known in 2008. Albums like 'Yugen' (Young Turks, 2013) with its exquisite sounds are the reason that gurus like Mark Pritchard, Giles Peterson and Benji B have raved about him. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Biard, also known by the name of Eman, has been placing his visual talent at the disposal of electronic and dance music producers and artists for several years. He has worked closely with the Fabric club in London, he is part of the platform Hoya:Hoya with Illum Sphere and Lone, he has created impressive sound installations (such as 'The Hall' and 'The Testudo') and designed the complex mirror set-up for Daedelus' concerts.

A sound that also defined the excellent 'Quantum Jelly', released by Editions Mego in 2012, considered by many to be one of the most ground-breaking works of electronica this decade. With his new album, Senni reaffirms his position as a tireless investigator and innovator of dance music mechanisms, following a similar path –but from a different perspective– to that of Lee Gamble with his albums on the PAN label. His music possesses a strange duality somewhere between the sensory impact of live sound and continual intellectual nourishment.

His revision of Adele’s 'Rolling In The Deep' marked a turning point in his career, followed by his remix LP of Gil Scott-Heron’s last recorded songs ('We're New Here').

In just a short space of time Daniel Avery has become an indispensable name of the electronic dance music scene in the UK, Europe and worldwide. Since his first steps into London’s DJ booths it became abundantly clear that Avery had a special knack for incorporating the fundamentals of house and techno into his dj sets, remixes and his own production tracks with an elegance, unusual depth and inventive rock influenced undertones. It was not long before Avery became part of the Fabric family and a club resident, next in line to the tech-house style first played by Ewan Pearson and Craig Richards. Soon to follow were his first EPs under the guidance of Erol Alkan, who recruited him to his label Phantasy Sound. His first album 'Drone Logic' was a defining moment and confirmed his quality as a producer. An album in which Avery journeys into hi fidelity, where sounds and exquisite tracks create the perfect environment, transporting the listener beyond reality and into outer space. To achieve this sound Avery developed long studio pieces that invite horizontal listening without sacrificing their dance floor appeal. Conversely when in the dj booth, these elements are more focussed towards dance floor effectiveness, while maintaining the melodic hooks and beautiful arrangements that characterize his compositions. This is clearly demonstrated in his excellent FabricLive mix. (text from www.sonar.es)"},

Troxler’s enormous popularity does not prevent him continuing to maintain a critical attitude to the mainstream and remaining devoted to the principles of independent music, primarily through his connection to the Visionquest label, and more recently with the new Tuskegee platform, created together with his regular partners in crime, The Martinez Brothers. Born in a small village between Detroit and Chicago of Cherokee and Egyptian descent, Troxler knew from a very young age that he was destined to be a dj. He was heavily influenced by a music loving stepfather and an unexpected slice of luck (or perhaps divine intervention), when as a teenager his two turntables and mixer were rescued from a fire. His knowledge of house and techno music is encyclopaedic. He has lived in Berlin for several years; played in the best clubs around the world; remixed Blood Orange, David Lynch, Tracey Thorn, Azari & III and Fever Ray, and frequently collaborates with other DJs and producers, including Jackmaster, Modeselektor, Art Department and Matthew Dear.

Musician, producer, DJ and sound engineer, Rafael Pérez has actively participated in many of his country’s most important hip-hop projects since the late nineties, as well as other music genres including electronica and rock. In fact, his name appears on more than 50 album credits that have been released in Chile in recent years. He is an accomplished turntablist and dance floor rap techniques specialist, and for years has worked in tandem with Latin Bitman, playing 4 deck sets under the name RVSB (Raff vs Bitman).

Denis Jasarevic has been making high-octane music since 2008 under the Gramatik moniker, seeing his popularity steadily grow over time. Denis's first love is hip-hop, which is still the foundation of his sound. However, his innate passion for music has inevitably led him to develop tracks using a wealth of different genres: jazz, soul, rock, techno, funk, blues... His compositions have much in common with some of today’s new batch of producers, like Pretty Lights, for instance, with whom he shares a taste for incorporating numerous acoustic sounds in a digital context. When performing live, synthesizers and traditional instruments are boosted in equal measure by the onstage presence of a guitarist playing blues and funk solos, alongside Gramatik’s cutting breaks. Haling from the Slovenian coastline but now living in New York, Jasarevic is a strong advocate for free culture. He recently launched the Lowtemp label, whose output aims to represent the sounds of young producers and musicians around the world. His motto is: 'freeing music by making music free'. He has also collaborated on tracks with several upcoming talents, helping to uncover the likes of Exmag, Gibbz and Branx.

His latest EP 'Walter's Call', is a good example of the sound that defines him: saxophones and trumpets harking back to jazz bands of the 1950s, his own broken beat treatments –even footwork– and exquisite digital production.

Swindle's love of jazz stems from when he learned to play the piano at the tender age of eight. He grew up listening to Stevie Wonder, Miles Davis and George Benson, and at 16 he was already composing instrumental pieces from a small studio set up in his bedroom. He soon discovered grime scene and collaborated with MCs, reflected by  'The 140 Mixtape' in 2007, which served as springboard towards his future career.

They have played almost the world over, sharing the stage and billing with a host of global pop stars. Their first album, 'Vol. 1 '(2008) won over the Colombian audience and saw them tour throughout Latin America; the following year they increased their audience base with 'Estalla' (also entitled 'Blow Up'), an album that significantly expanded their sonic palette and showed clear examples of their great potential.

One of Molina’s music passions is eighties synth pop and he cites Duran Duran among his favourites; with this in mind there is nobody better qualified to play the set prior to the English group’s concert at SonarClub on Saturday. Molina is a dj from head to toe and he has done much to dignify the term and the profession. Since the mid nineties he has been an integral figure of Spanish electronica and his sets consistently do more than simply move a dance floor, incorporating music that challenges, demands attention and questions genres and conventions of electronica. His relationship with Sónar has been long and fruitful ever since his first set at the first festival; and it will continue in 2015 with another very special performance. (text from www.sonar.es)"},

Iconic British rock band and worldwide chart-toppers Duran Duran (who have sold over 100 million records), will make their first Sónar appearance this summer, presenting an incredible live set, comprising material from across their extraordinary career. Currently in the studio, working on a new record with super-star producers Mark Ronson, Nile Rodgers and Mr. Hudson, this new body of work (their 14th studio album) promises to be one of their best yet. With a number of internationally renowned guest performers, including former Red Hot Chili Peppers’ guitarist John Frusciante and Sex Pistols’ guitarist Steve Jones amongst others, the new album is scheduled for release this September. The group’s appearance at Sónar will be one of only a handful of performances in advance of their upcoming record release, making the show particularly special. Duran Duran was formed at the dawn of the 1980s, in Birmingham, England by John Taylor and Nick Rhodes, and by 1981, with a line up that included singer Simon LeBon, guitarist Andy Taylor and drummer Roger Taylor, they were ready to release their self-titled debut LP. Inspired by glam rock, The Velvet Underground’s art rock, David Bowie’s wide-ranging pop, punk and dance music, Duran Duran rapidly took the world by storm, fusing the visual imperatives of the era with cutting edge fashion, film and technology to create something that was entirely new and compelling. Within less than a couple of years, they were a household name around the world and three decades later, they continue to break new ground, and perform for screaming fans across five continents. Ever active, the group has won no fewer than six Lifetime Achievement and style awards over the last few years and worked with some of the top names in music and film, including Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Brandon Flowers, Billy Corgan, Kelis and David Lynch, who most recently directed a stunning live concert film Duran Duran: Unstaged, which was featured at Cannes and launched MoMA’s Contenders series in New York City. Duran Duran’s unrivaled vision, celebrated songwriting prowess and incredible live shows continue to make them a truly global force to be reckoned with: a group of unique and everlasting appeal, whose future has never looked brighter.

An avid music lover hailing from L'Hospitalet, in recent years Adrian Uroz has become one of the most popular and versatile djs in Barcelona. His love for all music genres is abundantly clear in his far-reaching mixes, some of which can be accessed via his soundcloud account. He is able to mix the best Manchester indie with current electronica (something that he did regularly in the legendary clubs of his hometown, Salamandra and Depóstio Legal), and then masterfully veer towards cosmic wave and neodisco, moving seamlessly into repetitive 4x4 techno rhythms, the prevalent Moog club style, where he is currently the resident dj. He will look to reaffirm his versatility with an opening set at the SonarCar stage on Saturday night. (text from www.sonar.es)"},

The latest addition to the line up –joining the likes of PXXR GVNG, Southern Hospitality, Dj Sliink and Dj Detweiler among others– is Will Blake. Behind this moniker is Mime, the instinctive hip-hop producer and beatmaker from Tarragona who has already spent many years crafting rhythms, always remaining true to his own taste and intuition regardless of shifting music trends. Known throughout the underground scene for his devotion and talent, Mime begins a new journey as Will Blake, with whom he explores sounds close to that of trap. His new tracks and edits (such as the one dedicatied to Patrick Swayze or a cool version of a Die Antwoord track) will lead him directly to Sónar by Night’s most riotous stage.

They have recently expanded their operation to Los Angeles, though, where they have started to throw parties and make their mark on the Californian metropolis’ scene. As a label, Southern Hospitality have released material by Beatking, Danny Brown & Darq E Freaker and Yung Nation, although their main focus, and the reason why they are internationally renowned and followed by millions of fans, ara the mixtapes: exciting sessions that have become essential for anyone who wants to keep abreast of the best of rap, trap, r&b and all their many derivatives.

Trap, is a genre that emerged in the southern United States, which has much in common with hip hop, bass music and digital production. In this sound Lean is in his element and one of the most talented beatmakers in the country. Although all four members are very young, they share a clear vision and are already masters of social networking, posting new ideas and videos, with their own Youtube channel causing debate week after week. The will release their first official EP next June 10th. Their lyrics also demonstrate an assured confidence in their own identity, talking about sex and drugs in provocative and unedited street slang, while also having no qualms about showing sensitivity, including romantic elements. However this romanticism is tinged with melancholy and positioned in a decadent urban context. All these ingredients make PXXR GVNG the real deal, the national answer to groups like Odd Future in which their fans -among whom is American rapper Wacka Flocka- have not stopped growing.

Nobody knows the true identity of DJ Detweiler, the enigmatic figure who shot to fame on Internet forums with his astonishing remixes. What makes Detweiler stand out are his reinterpretations of hits from all possible ages and genres (Miley Cyrus, 'Chariots of Fire', 'Last Christmas' by Wham!, Rudimental and 'Baker Street' by Gerry Rafferty are just some examples) with a flute out of key, with a style he named 'flutedrop', a technique that converted the practice of 'trolling' and misappropriation into art. But this is now history: Detweiler killed off the genre he invented by issuing an explanatory note on his last soundcloud release on 18 November 2014. Now, Detweiler has reinvented himself and will appear on Saturday 20 at Sónar by Night to perform a dj set at SonarCar, a stage on which he will underline concepts like 'unpredictability' and 'peculiarity' with even greater force. Also keep an eye on his next movements, which will include remixes and possible collaborations with one today’s key labels: PC Music. (text from www.sonar.es)"},

They do not wish to reveal their identities and the apparatus they have prepared for their performance at SonarCar is as yet unknown; what we do know, though, is that their tracks have been doing the rounds on the national underground electronica circuit and that they are regulars at the monthly La Trap Jaus parties at Razzmatazz in Barcelona. One last important fact: their bombastic 'No Me La Flipo' is the opening track of compilation 'Iberian Juke Vol. 1', curated by BSN Posse, which brings together 21 new rhythm style tracks from young domestic producers in genres like juke, trap and footwork.

Dynamic is an adjective usually attributed to Meneo. 'Cheeky' is another that fits well. The Guatemalan artist now residing in Madrid –real name is Rigo Pex (or not)– is halfway between a concert and performance punk. Meneo twists up cumbia with a gameboy, and can be seen jumping around the stage as if possessed by the spirit of James Brown, with flowing rhythms so hot they melt underfoot, transforming Reggaeton into the coolest genre on the planet. By the end of his performance, whether he is naked or clothed (nudity being something that occurs with regularity) is almost immaterial. Meneo studied musicology at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala and founded Tripnótica, the first group of his country’s electronica scene. He was also a member of several bands including Pealcubo and Chichikúa, and launched the Habitart festival, dedicated to artistic installations. Once in Spain he moved to Barcelona and continued to reinvent himself via microBCN, another group of musicians, who this time fashioned music with consoles and 8 bit melodies. Just before moving to Madrid he created his Meneo alias to develop his solo career. His latest albums for Subterfuge, 'Larele' and 'El Jardin' are good examples of his total lack of musical prejudice, but obviously do not quite do justice to what Meneo offers when live on stage.

The result is powerful, raw, catchy and perfect for the dance floor. Sliink is the epitome of today’s young artists, passionate about music, skilful on the turntables and already making his mark in his first steps as a producer, including a joint release with maestro Mike Q on Fade To Mind (Nguzunguzu and Kingdom’s label), pulsating remixes of tracks from Theophilus London, Zebra Katz and Danny Brown, and a compilation including his own edits and others from members of the Music Cartel collective to which he belongs.
